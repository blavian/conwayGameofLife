# Conway's Game of Life

## Overview
Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game designed by mathematician John Conway in 1970. 

## Rules
The game takes place on a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The rules determining the next state of a cell are:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).
